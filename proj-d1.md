## Project - Deliverable \# 1 Feedback 
 
Great idea for a project! I think the scope is good for the amount of time you have left in the quarter. The only concern is getting the tweet data needed via the Twitter API. Another group found this Python package: 

https://github.com/twintproject/twint

That might be useful in getting the data necessary for your analysis. Overall this looks good and keep going!
